- Implementaion of stack using arrays
    stack.cpp
        define methods
        -push (takes a parameterof object type T)
            increment the index that we want to push our object c
            then insert the c in the array at the index incremented
        -pop (no parameters)
            check if the array is not empty 
            topIndex is initalized -1, and if there is no element in an array it would be < 0
            therby checking if topIndex is > 0, we check if empty or not
                if not empty
                    return an element at top of the array
                    then decrement the index
        -peek (no parameter)
            check if the array is not empty 
                return an element at top of the array

    balancing.cpp
        complete the algorithm in the loop
        -give the character at the index of itteration from the string  to variable c 
        - condidtion 1 (check if the characters are opening , '{', '[', '(')
            then 
                push to stack
            
        - condition 2 (check if the characters are closing , '}', ']', ')')
            then 
                check if stack is empty
                    then its not balanced 
                check if the top of stack and the current character are not complemntary ('{' and ']' or '(' and '}')
                    then its not balanced


    postfixEval.cpp
        complete the algorithm in the loop

    infix2postfix.cpp
        complete the algorithm in the loop
